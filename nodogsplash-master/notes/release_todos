8. remove /docs/build directory created in step 6
9. Push to origin
10. Github - Create Pull Request and Merge to master
11. Github proceed to "Draft New Release"
12. Github tag release as eg. v3.3.0 (remembering the leading "v"") (or use git tag -a v3.3.0 -m "nodogsplash release 3.3.0 " and git push --tags.)
13. In your local repository, make a new branch called "stable"
